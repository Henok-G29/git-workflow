    <h1>Git Workflow</h1>
    <p>Git workflow is a set of guidelines or best practices for using Git effectively in a team environment. It helps to ensure that everyone is on the same page and that code changes are managed efficiently. There are several popular Git workflows, including:</p>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Centralized Workflow:</strong> In this workflow, all developers push their changes to a central repository. It is simple and easy to understand, but it can lead to conflicts if multiple developers are working on the same codebase.</li>
        <li><strong>Feature Branch Workflow:</strong> In this workflow, developers create separate branches for each feature or bug fix they are working on. This allows for better organization and isolation of changes, making it easier to manage and review code.</li>
        <li><strong>Gitflow Workflow:</strong> This workflow is based on the feature branch workflow but adds additional branches for development, release, and hotfixes. It provides a structured approach to managing code changes and releases.</li>
        <li><strong>Forking Workflow:</strong> In this workflow, developers fork the main repository and work on their own copy. They then submit pull requests to merge their changes back into the main repository. This is commonly used in open-source projects.</li>
